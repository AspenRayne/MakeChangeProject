# Make Change Project


## Description
This Make Change project lets the users input of an item cost and how much they are giving to pay for that item, to be able to be calculated how much change they will get back.
From pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and bills ranging from one, fives, tens, and twenties.
It calculates it accurately so the user doesnt have to worry about if they are getting the correct change back or not.


## What I Learned
I learned how useful casting can be when dealing with decimals.
I also learned that operating with doubles can have many decimal points, which can cause the outcome to be inaccurate;
adding 0.001 can fix inaccuracies with decimal places.


## Technologies used
Eclipse, Atom, Java, and Git.
